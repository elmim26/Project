#SUBMISSION:
Q1.
This function takes an array of paints and a color, then returns a smaller array with only the paints that match the color based on their hue angle. I picked the hue ranges based on standard color wheel divisions (e.g., RED is 350–360° and 0–20°, GREEN is 140–180°). If there are no matches or the inputs are invalid, it returns NULL.

q2. my partner told me that he would submit his part late so i should submit mine ahead

q3. Made a dynamic menu-driven program for managing and displaying color palettes, allowing users to select palette types, set properties, and view their choices interactively.
